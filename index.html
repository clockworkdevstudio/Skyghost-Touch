<h1>Skyghost Touch</h1>
<p>Skyghost Touch is a retro 80s-style asteroid shooter. It's designed for Android tablets and large Android smartphones. The game combines frenetic asteroid-blasting fun with realistic physics (rigid body dynamics) and authentic-sounding 80s-style sound-effects generated by a Commodore 64 emulator. It is free (libre) under the FreeBSD license. Watch the video below and download the game <a href="https://github.com/clockworkdevstudio/Skyghost-Touch/releases">here</a></p>
